#Project 3: Pong

The classic game of pong is brought back and now it can fit in your pocket.  This game is designed for those who work alone often and do not have time to socialize.  This game is a perfect way to pass the time.

#GamePlay

The game is created to cater to those who enjoy a fast paced playing environment.  Once the game is loaded the pong ball commences to move immediately.  The player is challenged to try and get as high a score as possible.  Every game round, the player is awarded three lives.  The player can move the pong paddle by using the 1st and 4th buttons.  The first button moves the paddle in an upward direction, and the fourth button moves the paddle in a downward direction.  If the player is not pressing either of the buttons, the paddle remains in place.  The player is awarded 50 points everytime the paddle succesfully hits the ball.  If the player misses the ball, the player will lose their current score and the ball will respawn immediately so stay on your toes! Every new round resets the score and gives the player the opportunity to beat their highscore.   If the player misses the ball three times it will be GAME OVER! The players highest score will be displayed and the player has the option to play again by pressing any button.

Demo code was main source and heavilly modified to fit the needs of the game.
